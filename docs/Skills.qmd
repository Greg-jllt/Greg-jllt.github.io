<h4>BatchMonitor</h4>
<div class="content">
<p class="text-primary-emphasis">The BatchMonitor module aims to solve the following problem <a href="https://github.com/Greg-jllt/BatchMonitor/blob/main/resolution/Sujet.md">(link to the subject)</a> and to extend this problem to as many situations as possible.<br>BatchMonitor is a library that allows you to solve problems related to linear programming. It's designed to be easy to use and to provide a simple interface. You can use it to solve problems in a variety of domains, such as logistics, and manufacturing.<br>This library come with a web-app made with streamlit that allows you to quickly build and solve optimization problems and a CLI Typer. It also provides a set of tools and options to help you analyze and visualize the results of your optimization problems.<br>This module enables the resolution of various types of problems. We refer to one as MinBatchExpense, which aims to minimize the consumer's expenditure on different batches supplied by one or more batch sellers. The other is MaxEarnings, designed to maximize the profit of a unitary vendor.</p>
